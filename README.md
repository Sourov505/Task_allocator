# Task_allocator
This program takes commandline input for the datafile from where configuration will be fetched. There are two functions present in the code. 1. status_check 2. enhanced_search   The input argument for the two function are same. But outputs are different.status_check printsout "True" if the task should be executed immediately (If the current time is between start time and end time).Prints 'False' otherwise.Whereas, enhanced_search serach printssout "True" if the task should be executed immediately, but if not,  it also prints out when the task would be picked up next.
